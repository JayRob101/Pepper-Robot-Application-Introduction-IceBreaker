# Pepper Robot Application
*Sabancı University PURE - Spring 2021*

Robots have an active and irreplaceable place in almost every aspect of people's daily lives. As the studies 
in mechatronics and artificial intelligence progress, the areas where robots operate are increasing day by 
day. Especially with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, robots have started to be used more in many 
fields to reduce physical contact between people and to prevent the spread of the pandemic. In this project, 
it is aimed to develop a “Researcher Robot” which will take the role of research assistant and the robot will 
greet the incoming participants, chat with them and direct them to the correct study according to their 
preferences. In the scope of the project, the “Greeting and Ice-breaking” and “Taking Participants to the 
Research Room” part of the program of the robot had been developed. The implementation of this program 
focused on robots' interaction with humans and its interaction with the environment through its sensors.
The research and programming of these sections carried out through four main functionalities which were 
Dialogue, Face Detection, Speech Recognition and Movements. The SoftBank Robotics’ humanoid robot 
Pepper was used in this project and software development of the Pepper was carried out using Choregraphe 
2.5.10.7.
